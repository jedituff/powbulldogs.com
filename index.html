    <h4>KKKoba is a large dog exceeding 60 pounds.  Dagny is a mid-size bitch at around 41 pounds.  Generally, we are looking to breed smaller APBTs but temperament trumps all other factors and these two animals were too special - they had to be crossed.  Koba has demonstrated high intelligence levels and deep human connection.  Dagny is always seeking human affection but also demonstrated a will to protect her own.  Both have an on/off switch that is uncommon in high-drive dogs.  We expect to get animals ready to do whatever is asked of them, because it is asked of them, and to know when to hit that switch.</h4>
