    <h4 class="tan_color">Every domesticated dog in ever house and on every yard around the world is the product of thousands of years of selective breeding practices.  In the modern era, careful breeders have developed codified standards against which they can measure their animals before selecting breeding pairs.  Such care in breeding yields superior dogs with each subsequent generation.  It is over the course of many generations that the breeder's chosen dogs have come to him and it will be over the course of many generations that the breeder will continuously work to improve and perfect those genetics.  This can only be done properly with a true standard in mind.  At Proof of Work Bulldogs, we measure potential breeding dogs against the following standard:<br>
    <br>
    &emsp; Conformation - in accordance with the ADBA conformation standard.<br>
    <br>
    &emsp; Temperament - uncompromisingly people friendly, athletically superior, discriminatory intelligence, and unerringly game.<br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Generation Zero - 5 pups (3M/2F)</h2>
    <h4>Koba is a large dog exceeding 60 pounds.  He's demonstrated high levels of intelligence and human connection.  Dagny is a mid-size bitch at around 41 pounds.  She's always seeking human affection but has also demonstrated a will to protect her own.  Both have an on/off switch that is uncommon in high-drive dogs.  Generally, we are looking to breed smaller APBTs but temperament trumps all other factors and these two animals were too special - they had to be crossed.  We expect to get animals ready to do whatever is asked of them, because it is asked of them, and to know when to hit that switch.</h4>
