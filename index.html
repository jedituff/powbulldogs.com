    <h4>Real results demand real work.  At Proof of Work Bulldogs, we demand that work be done.  Our dogs will prove themselves with real work in the field before they get the chance to breed and represent the American Pitbull Terrier.  Some of that work will be chronicled here and some via social media channels.  We're going to show that these dogs can be worked in legal, fun, and healthy ways that are good for the dogs and good for their handlers.  Stay tuned!</h4>

    <h2>Generation Zero - 5 pups (3M/2F)</h2>
    <h4>Koba is a large dog exceeding 60 pounds.  He's demonstrated high levels of intelligence and human connection.  Dagny is a mid-size bitch at around 41 pounds.  She's always seeking human affection but has also demonstrated a will to protect her own.  Both have an on/off switch that is uncommon in high-drive dogs.  Generally, we are looking to breed smaller APBTs but temperament trumps all other factors and these two animals were too special - they had to be crossed.  We expect to get animals ready to do whatever is asked of them, because it is asked of them, and to know when to hit that switch.</h4>
